* Secondary Memory
- Lowest cost
- Highest Capacity
- Slowest access
- For keeping data in long term storage
- Not in immediate use.

** Two types
1. Sequential access: Accessed in linear sequence
   eg: magnetic tape
2. Direct access: random access
   eg: rotating drums, disks, CD-ROM

*** Magnetic Disk:
- Higher cap and reliability
- direct access
- Circular plate, created with magnetic oxide layer
eg: HDD, FDD (floppy)
- Data represented as magnetized clusters
**** Organisation of Disk
- disk divided into platters
- each platter consists of concentric circles = TRACKS
- track divided into SECTORS ( smallest division in disk )
- Each platter has a mechanical arm = r/w head
  * Used to read/write from/to disk
  * Head has to reach at a particular track and then wait for rotation of platter
  * Rotation causes required sector of back to come under head
  * Speed -> 7200 rpm - 10000 rpm
- Each platter has 2 surfaces ( top & bottom ) which store data
- Each surface has own r/w head
**** How to Measure Disk Performance
- Transfer rate: rate at which data flows between drive and comp
- Positioning time ( Random Access time ):
  * Time to move disk arm to desired cylinder ( seek time )
  * time for desired sector to rotate under the disk head ( rotational latency )
